# Disney Quiz
Disney Quiz is my second project for Code Institute. My original idea for the second project was a NASA quiz, but I wanted to create a quiz that was a bit more fun and colourful. I started creating the NASA quiz, but I felt it became more of an educational tool (which is great and that will be something I would love to do in the future). I also wanted to create a quiz that everyone would know and everyone knows Disney. 

Starting on the NASA quiz, I did much of the commits there. Looking at the Disney quiz it does not seem like I have enough commits and it was due to changing my mind pretty much at the last minute.

## User Experience

### User Stories
My original idea for a quiz was a NASA Quiz, which allowed the user to start the quiz and chose an answer and if incorrect they would have received fact/info about the question. I felt that it would be an awesome tool for young students learning about the different space agencies, but I felt that it wasn't as fun. 



For the Disney Quiz, user would automatically get their first question and they would have to chose an answer and right away they would be told if they got the correct or incorrect answer by the button turning green (correct) or red(incorrect). When the user gets clicks on the incorrect button it would turn red and the correct button would turn green. When the user finishes the last question, the screen will display the score out of the total questions, and a button if the user would want to try again.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme that I used for Disney Quiz was influenced by the 90s. Growing up in the 90s, I remember these colours being everywhere when we went to Disney World. 

![Disney Quiz Colour Scheme](/assets/images/readme-images/PP2-Colour-Scheme.png)

### Typography
The two fonts I used are from Google Fonts. The font used for the body was Pangolin and for h1, h2, and h3 was Shadows Into Light Two. My default font was Sans-serif. I decided on Pangolin and Shadows Into Light Two because of their playful nature. They capture the overall idea of the website, which is playful. Calm, but playful (just like the cats). 

- Luckiest Guy - Used for h3 (Disney Quiz Title)

![Luckiest Guy](/assets/images/readme-images/Luckiest%20Guy%20Font.png)

- Patrick Hand - Used for questions, answer options, and footer

### Imagery
For the imagery of the site, I wanted to use a Disney background and the colours of the quiz is 90s theme. The colours really brought back memories of Disney when I was growing up. The background image of 

### Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to bring my ideas to "life". There was a lot that I added to the wireframes, but I had to delete the cafe page due to time and had to let go of some of the ideas due to knowledge and time. I did add this to my future implementation section. Thank You page was not thought of right at the beginning. It was a page that was added towards the end of the project based on suggestion on the Slack community. I have added the Thank You image to the Feature section.

## Features

### General features on each page
- Nav/Menu

Nav/Menu bar has four main buttons situated on the right with the logo in the middle and title on the left. The logo and title are linked to the Home page, so when clicked in the other pages it will take the user back to the Home page. I used the same concept as in the Love Running project, where the menu buttons will highlight with a line on the bottom to let the user know which page they are on. The title, logo, and menu buttons do change position depending on screen sizes. The responsive image at the top of the READme show this. 

![Navigation and Menu](/assets/readme-images/nav-menu.png)

- Logo

The logo was sourced from [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and I changed the colour to coincide with the autumn colours. 

![Logo](/assets/readme-images/logo-readme.png)

- Favicon

The favicon was taken from the logo that was sourced from [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). 

![Favicon](/assets/readme-images/favicon-readme.png)

- Home Hero Image

In my wireframes, my Home hero image was different, but this image was picked due to it being a perfect representation of what the website is: Cats and Coffee!

![Home Hero Image](/assets/readme-images/home-hero-image.png)

- Home Introduction

The Home page is more of an overview of the People and Cats page. The Home Introduction section is more like the ethos in the Love Running project.

![Home Introduction](/assets/readme-images/home-intro.png)

- Home Cats

Here I tried to hit the main points about the Cats and who we partnered with to help with the adoption. I have attached a link to the DSPCA so users can click and it will take them directly to the DSPCA's website (People page also has this). I have also linked the Cats page so if the user wants to go directly to the Cats page from this point on the page they can. 

![Home Cats](/assets/readme-images/home-cats.png)

- Home People

This section is also a place where I tried to hit the main points about the People page. 

![Home People](/assets/readme-images/home-people.png)

- Footer

The footer houses the social networks logos: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. I also added that the Site was created for educational purposes. 

![Footer](/assets/readme-images/footer-social-networks.png)

- People Hero Image

Due to this page being called People page, I wanted a hero image that had a cat and a person. 

![People Hero Image](/assets/readme-images/people-hero-image.png)

- Mo and Eva

The Mo and Eva section, which has the heading of "Behind every idea there is a story..." is essentially the about us page. It starts with the story behind the idea of Whiskers N Whole Bean and Mo and Eva are the start of that. Mo and Eva are my actual cats and they were adopted. They do also have a brother called Thorin, who is a labrador. The image used here is my personal photo. 

![Mo and Eva](/assets/readme-images/people-mo-eva.png)

- People Rescue 

The Rescue section is where I go a bit more into detail about the reasons behind partnering up with the DSPCA. The word DSPCA is linked so the user can click and go straight to their website. I also mention if they want to go straight to meet the cats they can click on the Book Here link that I provided, which would take them straight to the Book Here page. 

![People Rescue](/assets/readme-images/people-rescue.png)

- People Cafe

In my wireframes, I dedicated a whole page to the cafe, but because of time I had to scrap it. But, it is a cat cafe, so I took this area to hit some of the points about the cafe.

![People Cafe](/assets/readme-images/people-cafe.png)

- Cats Hero Image

In my images, I wanted to show cats as natural as possible (like you would take a picture of them yourself at home). And, I think this picture was perfect. I also like it due to many cats housed in foster or rescue care are not always kittens, some of them might be a bit older. And, they are still awesome to adopt.

![Cats Hero Image](/assets/readme-images/cats-hero-image.png)

- Cats Main Text

The main text in this section mentions how the cats are named after literary characters or authors. I also mention reasons as to why users would need to book to see the cats. 

![Cats Main Text](/assets/readme-images/cats-page.png)

- Cats Gallery 

I took the idea of the gallery from the Love Running project. I wanted to convey cats just being cats that are housed in Whiskers N Whole Beans. I also tried to find images that showed some sort of personality to them. 

![Cat Gallery](/assets/readme-images/cats-gallery.png)

- Book Here Form

Book Here form was sourced from the Love Runnigng project, but tweaked it to fit the design of the website. I do like how round corners looked, so I round the book here box, the three inputs, and the Book Here! button. The radio buttons consists of Morning, Afternoon, Evening and these concide with the hours underneath the book here form. This allows the user to know what time of day they would like to visit. 

![Book Here Form](/assets/readme-images/book-here-form.png)

- Hours of Operation

Because of the booking element of the website, I added hours of operation to help guide the user in picking which time works best for them. Initally, I wanted to put this in the footer, but it was not cooperating with me. But, putting it under the Book Here form actually worked better. 

![Hours of Operation](/assets/readme-images/hours-operation.png)

- Our Location

The location is based on different places that I have lived with Mo and Eva all woven togther. The address together as a whole is not a actual address. 

![Our Location](/assets/readme-images/our-location.png)

- Thank You Page

Once the user enters their details and clicks Book Here! They are presented with a Thank You Page. The page lets them know that we have received the request and they should be receiving an email soon. 

![Thank You Page](/assets/readme-images/thank-you-page.png)

- Thank You Logo Stamp

The Thank You Stamp was created in Canva using the sourced cat logo. It conviently goes with the saying on the Thank You page of "You have received the seal of approval".

![Thank You Logo Stamp](/assets/readme-images/logo-stamp-readme.png)

### Future Implementations
- I would like to add a intro page and when you click on start the user begins the quiz. 
- Sound would be a great addition. 


### Accessibility
With every image and icon used throughout Whiskers N Whole Beans, I have added an aria-label or an alt attribute. I tried to use colour that was not to bright or light. The font is readable, but I do feel for future projects, I would do more research on what fonts are more accessible.

The desktop version for Lighthouse gave great numbers, but the mobile was not the greatest for Performance (image below). I would like to work on that and see what I can do to make that better. I used WAVE for the contrast, which gave back 0 errors (image below).

Lighthouse Desktop Version.

## Credits

### Code Used
Whiskers N Whole Beans would be the first website I have ever built, so I relied on Code Institute's Love Running project to guide me through the process. Although I used it as a guide, I tweak the code to fit the website. For example, the menu in the navigation bar. The book here form was based on the Love Running project form, but tweaked it to fit the design of the website. 

### Content
Questions were written by Amanda Pita. 

Questions were all from my knowledge of Disney. I'm a big Disney fan, so 

### Media
Mo and Eva image in the People page is from my personal photos.

### Acknowledgments
I would like to first give thanks to my husband (who would look at me with a straight and understanding face when I was explaining to him what the code does). He was my rubber duck for the marjority of the project. 

I'm extremely grateful to my mentor Martina who guided me through the process and helped convince me that I'm doing fine and can actually do it! Helped me a lot especially when imposter symdrome started creeping in.
