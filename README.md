# Disney Quiz
Disney Quiz is my second project for Code Institute. My original idea for the second project was a NASA quiz, but I wanted to create a quiz that was a bit more fun and colourful. I started creating the NASA quiz, but I felt it became more of an educational tool (which is great and that will be something I would love to do in the future). I also wanted to create a quiz that everyone would know and everyone KNOWS Disney. 

Starting on the NASA quiz, I did much of the commits there. Looking at the Disney quiz it does not seem like I have enough commits and it was due to changing my mind pretty much at the last minute.

## User Experience

### User Stories
My original idea for a quiz was a NASA Quiz, which allowed the user to start the quiz and chose an answer and if incorrect they would have received fact/info about the question. I felt that it would be an awesome tool for young students learning about the different space agencies, but I felt that it wasn't as fun. 

For the Disney Quiz, user would automatically get their first question and they would have to chose an answer and right away they would be told if they got the correct or incorrect answer by the button turning green (correct) or red (incorrect). When the user clicks on the incorrect button it would turn red and the correct button would turn green. When the user finishes the last question, the screen will display the score out of the total questions, and a button if the user would want to play again.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme that I used for Disney Quiz was influenced by the 90s. Growing up in the 90s, I remember these colours being everywhere when we went to Disney World. 

![Disney Quiz Colour Scheme](/assets/images/readme-images/PP2-Colour-Scheme.png)

### Typography
The two fonts I used are from Google Fonts. The font used for the quiz heading was 'Luckiest Guy'. I felt this came as close to Disney "90s" style as possible. I also wanted to make it as fun and quirky as possible. It is a simple quiz, but wanted to bring back fun memories. The fonts for the question, answer options, and footer are 'Patrick Hand.' I think this also conveyed the fun side to the quiz. 

- Luckiest Guy - Used for h3 (Disney Quiz Title)

![Luckiest Guy](/assets/images/readme-images/Luckiest%20Guy%20Font.png)

- Patrick Hand - Used for questions, answer options, and footer

### Imagery
For the imagery of the site, I wanted to use a Disney background and the colours of the quiz is 90s theme. The colours really brought back memories of Disney when I was growing up. The Disney amusement park background just adds to the fun aspect that I wanted to bring to the quiz. 

### Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create the backbone of the NASA Quiz. When I decided to change and do the Disney Quiz, I downsized the idea. There wasn't a separate start to the quiz or a separate screen that would show the right and wrong answer and facts. With the Disney Quiz, I went with the colour of the buttons changing from green to red if the user selected the wrong or right answer. The Javascript of the Disney Quiz was influenced by the GreatStack YouTube tutorial, so the end result took that format. The wireframes below is the idea of want I wanted to do, which I would like do in the future.

![End of quiz/score](/assets/images/readme-images/Score.png)

- Footer

The footer is placed inside the container for easy viewing. I also added that the Site was created for educational purposes. 

![Footer](/assets/images/readme-images/Footer.png)

### Future Implementations
- I would like to add a intro page and when you click on start the user begins the quiz. 
- Sound would be a great addition. 
- I would like to add a timer and more info on the correct or incorrect answers (idea taken from the NASA Quiz idea).
- I would like to implement the NASA Quiz as well. 
- I enjoyed the colours that I used, but it did receive some contrast errors in the WAVE tool. For future implementations, I would like to play with various colours. 

### Accessibility
Both the desktop and mobile version for Lighthouse gave great numbers. The number for WAVE, especially for contrast, were not great. This is due to the colours of the buttons that are being used. 

Lighthouse Desktop Version.

## Credits

### Code Used
Javascript was difficult for me. It is something that I most definitely need much more practice in. So, I really relied on outside sources to help me with this project. 

- GreatStack from YouTube was a great help. It was a tutorial that made it easy to follow. Although I changed some bits to cater to my quiz, this tutorial formed the basis of my Javascript. 

[GreatStack YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBcqGxrr9g8&list=PLjwm_8O3suyOgDS_Z8AWbbq3zpCmR-WE9&index=3)

- I'm also still getting the hang of CSS especially with flexbox, as well as, rem. So I used the flexbox code section from James Quick YouTube/Udemy tutorial in my HTML/CSS.

### Acknowledgments
Again, I would like to give thanks to my husband. Who I kept on asking to check if the quiz worked on his phone even though I could have checked it on my phone. But, two sets of eyes are better then one. 

As always, I'm extremely grateful to my mentor Martina who encourages me, especially when I was ready to call it quits. The best mentor anyone can ask for!
